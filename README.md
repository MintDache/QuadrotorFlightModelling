Quadrotor Flight Modelling!
1. Introduction
This repository contains code and resources for modeling and simulating the flight dynamics of a quadrotor. Specifically, the focus is on controlling the pitch of the quadrotor using a linear model obtained under certain assumptions. The autopilot designed in this project aims to regulate and stabilize the pitch of the aircraft.
